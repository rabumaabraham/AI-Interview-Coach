## 🚀 Project Overview

AI Interview Coach transforms traditional interview prep by creating dynamic, personalized experiences. By analyzing a job description, the application generates custom questions, reads them aloud, listens to your spoken responses, and delivers structured, AI-powered feedback including evaluation of your facial expressions and vocal tone to help improve both verbal and non verbal communication skills.
